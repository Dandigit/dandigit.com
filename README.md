# Website
This is the source code of my website, Dandigit.com. It utilises a backend server that I wrote in Go, which allows me to easily
write a blog post by creating a new `.post` file in the `posts/` directory. No new HTML is needed, no new pages - everything is
handled automatically.

I'm currently hosting this on Digital Ocean.
